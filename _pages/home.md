## Welcome

I'm a first-year PhD student at [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en) and McGill University under the supervision of [Dr. Jackie Cheung](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/index.html). I'm part of the [McGill NLP Group](https://mcgill-nlp.github.io/).

Previously, I spent a year as a faculty affiliate researcher at the Vector Institute in Toronto, working with Drs. Scott Sanner and Chris McIntosh of the University of Toronto. 

I spent my undergraduate years at the University of Waterloo, where I earned a Bachelor of Computer Science with a minor in Statistics. 

## Research Interests

My long-term research interests are in Natural Language Processing, Human-Computer Interaction, and Information Retrieval. I want to create intelligent interactive information-seeking systems which are trustworthy, democratic, and useful. I am also interested in the human impacts of modern information-seeking systems.

I am currently working on multi-agent planning and coordination.
