## Welcome

I’m a faculty affiliate researcher at the Vector Institute in Toronto. I’m currently working with Dr. Scott Sanner and Dr. Chris McIntosh of the University of Toronto. I hold a B.CS from the University of Waterloo in Computer Science with a minor in Statistics.

## Research Interests

My research interests are in Natural Language Processing, Human-Computer Interaction, and Information Retrieval. My long-term goal is to develop intelligent interactive systems. I think that these systems should be safe, accessible, rational, and multimodal.

I am leading a project with Dr. Sanner to extend decision-theoretic conversational recommendation systems to handle an unbounded language space. We combine the long-term planning provided by decision theory with the free language interaction of LLMs.

My current research with Dr. McIntosh aims to develop a multimodal foundation model that is able to unify medical modalities (e.g. ECG, CXR) using text as a shared embedding space (similar to Med-PaLM-M and ImageBind).
