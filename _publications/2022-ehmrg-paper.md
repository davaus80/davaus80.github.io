title: "Comparison of machine learning and the regression-based EHMRG model for predicting early mortality in acute heart failure"
permalink: /publication/2022-ehmrg-paper
excerpt: 'Logistic regression was comparable to ML in discrimination, but was superior to ML algorithms in calibration overall. ML algorithms for prognosis should routinely report calibration metrics in addition to discrimination.'
